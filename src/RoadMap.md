Your table component already has many useful features, but here are some suggestions to enhance it further:

1. **Sorting:** Allow users to sort the table by clicking on column headers. This can be done by keeping track of the sort order and adding sorting functionality to each column. ✅

2. **Resizable Columns:** Add the ability to resize columns by dragging the edges. You can use a library like `react-table-resizable` to achieve this.

3. **Column Filtering:** Provide options to filter data in each column. Users could enter filter criteria, and the table would update dynamically.

4. **Column Reordering:** Allow users to drag and drop columns to rearrange their order in the table.

5. **Pagination Navigation:** Display page numbers and allow users to jump to a specific page directly.

6. **Selection:** Allow users to select rows, and provide callbacks for handling the selected rows. ✅

7. **Row Expansion:** Instead of a separate row for details, consider having an expandable row that reveals details inline.

8. **Customizable Styling:** Provide users with the ability to easily customize the styling of the table to fit different themes or design requirements. ✅

9. **Accessibility:** Ensure that the table is accessible by adding proper ARIA attributes and handling keyboard navigation.

10. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for cases where data fetching fails or there are issues with server pagination. ✅

11. **Responsive Design:** Ensure that the table layout is responsive, especially for smaller screens. Consider hiding/showing columns based on screen size.

12. **Loading State:** Improve the loading state by adding a spinner or a more informative loading message. ✅

13. **Tooltip for Cell Content:** If the content in a cell might get truncated, consider adding a tooltip to show the full content when hovered.

14. **Row Highlighting:** Add a visual indication when hovering over rows, making it clear which row the user is interacting with. ✅

15. **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for common actions, such as navigating pages or triggering certain operations.

16. **Internationalization (i18n):** Make your table component ready for internationalization by allowing customization of labels and messages.

Remember to implement these features based on your specific use case and the requirements of the application you are working on.
